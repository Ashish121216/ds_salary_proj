About Wells Fargo India

Wells Fargo India enables global talent capabilities for Wells Fargo Bank NA., by supporting business lines and staff functions across Technology, Operations, Risk, Audit, Process Excellence, Automation and Product, Analytics and Modeling. We are operating in Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Chennai locations.

Department Overview:

Corporate Model Risk (CMoR): Wells Fargo's Corporate Model Risk is responsible for independently overseeing the management of model risk exposures across the enterprise (including governing, monitoring, and reporting on aggregate model risk exposures, model validations, and model oversight across enterprise). This oversight extends to all phases of a model's life cycle, including identification, development, validation, implementation, finding resolution, usage, performance monitoring, documentation, and retirement.

About the Role:

CMoR operates in a fast-paced work environment with continuously changing policies and technologies. The successful candidate is expected to be self- motivated, require minimal supervision, and produce work that is consistent with CMoR's recognized high standards. Effective work will involve familiarity with source systems of record, analytical data and sampling plans, model replications, model performance assessments, and test model development as effective challenges to lines of business. It further requires strength in writing detailed standard analytical reports to ensure Wells Fargo's compliance with governance policies and regulations. Each validation report will include assessments of the specific business, model purpose and history, the model methodology, data integrity, model development, performance, implementation, and monitoring. These documents are read by a broad audience, including auditors and regulators.
CMoR serves as the second line of defense to ensure the integrity of Wells Fargo's model inventory. A Senior Quantitative Analytics Specialist is an individual contributor role. This position will focus primarily on Commercial Credit model validations. However, frequent special projects and seasonal requirements for CCAR validations will provide a variety of modeling contexts throughout each year. A validation project typically begins and ends with the analyst, requiring broad and continuous attention to detail, comprehensive documentation, and interactions with developers. Meetings with auditors and regulators will require recall of validation details.
A Senior Quantitative Analytics Specialist should have a deep academic knowledge, broad based approach to solutioning business problems. He/she should approach the problem agnostic of analytic technique, tool or process. Ability to think outside the box and provide ensemble solutions should set them apart to be a high performing team member.
Essential Skills:
5-8 years of experience with minimum Masters/Phd in a quantitative field such as Data Science, Statistics, econometrics, computer sciences, or any other behavioral sciences with a quantitative emphasis.
Candidate should have hands on experience on Python, Pyspark and related libraries. Understanding of SAS would be an additional plus.
Experience in model development/ model validation using techniques like Machine learning, Time Series Forecasting, Regression
Proven history of developing benchmarking and alternative models in Python/R/SAS.
Contributing to the improvement of model building and model use practices
Providing analytical support and offering insights regarding a wide array of business initiatives.
Experience in performing model validations and clearly documenting evidence of validation activities. Communicating model risk findings and limitations to key stakeholders
Desired Skills:
Strong mathematical, statistical, analytical and computational skills.
Candidates with experience in credit analytics, Stress Testing (CCAR, PRA, CECL) in Commercial/ Retail space will be preferred.

Wells Fargo India enables global talent capabilities for Wells Fargo Bank NA., by supporting business lines and staff functions across Technology, Operations, Risk, Audit, Process Excellence, Automation and Product, Analytics and Modeling. We are operating in Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Chennai locations.

Department Overview:

Corporate Model Risk (CMoR): Wells Fargo's Corporate Model Risk is responsible for independently overseeing the management of model risk exposures across the enterprise (including governing, monitoring, and reporting on aggregate model risk exposures, model validations, and model oversight across enterprise). This oversight extends to all phases of a model's life cycle, including identification, development, validation, implementation, finding resolution, usage, performance monitoring, documentation, and retirement.

About the Role:

CMoR operates in a fast-paced work environment with continuously changing policies and technologies. The successful candidate is expected to be self- motivated, require minimal supervision, and produce work that is consistent with CMoR's recognized high standards. Effective work will involve familiarity with source systems of record, analytical data and sampling plans, model replications, model performance assessments, and test model development as effective challenges to lines of business. It further requires strength in writing detailed standard analytical reports to ensure Wells Fargo's compliance with governance policies and regulations. Each validation report will include assessments of the specific business, model purpose and history, the model methodology, data integrity, model development, performance, implementation, and monitoring. These documents are read by a broad audience, including auditors and regulators.
CMoR serves as the second line of defense to ensure the integrity of Wells Fargo's model inventory. A Senior Quantitative Analytics Specialist is an individual contributor role. This position will focus primarily on Commercial Credit model validations. However, frequent special projects and seasonal requirements for CCAR validations will provide a variety of modeling contexts throughout each year. A validation project typically begins and ends with the analyst, requiring broad and continuous attention to detail, comprehensive documentation, and interactions with developers. Meetings with auditors and regulators will require recall of validation details.
A Senior Quantitative Analytics Specialist should have a deep academic knowledge, broad based approach to solutioning business problems. He/she should approach the problem agnostic of analytic technique, tool or process. Ability to think outside the box and provide ensemble solutions should set them apart to be a high performing team member.
Essential Skills:
5-8 years of experience with minimum Masters/Phd in a quantitative field such as Data Science, Statistics, econometrics, computer sciences, or any other behavioral sciences with a quantitative emphasis.
Candidate should have hands on experience on Python, Pyspark and related libraries. Understanding of SAS would be an additional plus.
Experience in model development/ model validation using techniques like Machine learning, Time Series Forecasting, Regression
Proven history of developing benchmarking and alternative models in Python/R/SAS.
Contributing to the improvement of model building and model use practices
Providing analytical support and offering insights regarding a wide array of business initiatives.
Experience in performing model validations and clearly documenting evidence of validation activities. Communicating model risk findings and limitations to key stakeholders
Desired Skills:
Strong mathematical, statistical, analytical and computational skills.
Candidates with experience in credit analytics, Stress Testing (CCAR, PRA, CECL) in Commercial/ Retail space will be preferred.

We see so many opportunities for what we can accomplish and have the ambition to be a world class team. At the same time, we believe that our work is not just about solving business problems, but also about learning and having fun together.
